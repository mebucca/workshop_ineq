# Workshop on inequality and stratification research

![image](image.png)

This workshop is a forum for academic discussion on these issues, understood in a broad sense. In each session, a presenter will discuss their academic work and receive feedback from the audience. Works in any stage of development are welcome, from ideas, preliminary results, to completed manuscripts.

> **Abstract:** Intermarriage between native- and immigrant-origin populations has traditionally been considered a tell-tale sign of assimilation among migration researchers. In Western Europe, a large and recent literature has identified the Muslim/non-Muslim boundary as a key relational and symbolic divide partially blocking assimilation - as exemplified in the low rates of intermarriage among the second-generation documented in prior work and typically attributed to cultural constraints, such as the transmission of family norms and high levels of individual religiosity. To appreciate the role of social boundaries in constraining intermarriage rates between second-generation Muslims and third-plus generation natives, we appraise the role of two separate factors: ethno-religious barriers on one hand, and educational assortative mating on the other hand. Furthermore, by looking at patterns of status exchange, we investigate whether barriers to intermarriage  emerge from hierarchical stratification or horizontal differentiation. Empirically, we focus on France - the European countries with the highest share of self-identified Muslims - and use log-linear models on high quality survey data featuring a large sample of natives and second-generation Muslim respondents. We find strong barriers to intermarriage between native and second generation Muslims, where the resulting shortage of mixed couples is largely independent of dynamics of educational assortative mating. We also find some evidence of exchange between "nativity capital" and "educational capital" in mixed couples, which suggests that minority status operates *de facto* as an stratifying factor.
